# SportsAPIProject
This Project uses thesportsdb API. I created an small app to look up teams, players and information about each player by sending requests to this API. After getting my response back as a JSON file i used this information and nicely display it on a user window. I used C# with some of its modules to do this project, so make sure you download those modules before running this App.
